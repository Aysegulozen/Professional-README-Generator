# Professional README Generator

## Description

The Professional README Generator is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file based on user input. This application uses the Inquirer package to prompt the user with a series of questions about their project. The user's responses are then used to generate a README file with sections such as Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, Tests, License, and Questions.

## Table of Contents

- [Usage](#usage)
